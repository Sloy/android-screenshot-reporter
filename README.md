# Android Screenshot Reporter

Take screenshot during your Espresso tests and see them later in a report.

The tool consists in two dependencies: a client library to take screenshots (based on [Falcon](https://github.com/jraska/Falcon)),
and a Gradle plugin to download those screenshots from a device and generate the report.
